## WHY THIS DIVISION WORKS

### Separation of Concerns
- **Revenue (PC 1)** is time-sensitive, high-stakes
- **Content (PC 2)** is important but can be batched/scheduled
- Different mental modes don't interfere

### Parallel Execution
- While you're on a sales call (PC 1), content is being drafted (PC 2)
- While content publishes (PC 2), you're emailing leads (PC 1)
- Maximum productivity, zero downtime

### Risk Distribution
- If Brandverse sales slow, Mr. Anfield builds your authority
- If Mr. Anfield traffic drops, Brandverse generates cash
- Two revenue streams, two projects advancing

### Agent Specialization
- PC 1 agent becomes EXPERT at sales/revenue
- PC 2 agent becomes EXPERT at content/SEO
- Better than one generalist agent

---

## CROSS-PC COORDINATION

### Weekly Sync (15 minutes)
**What:** Both agents report to you
**When:** Every Monday morning
**Output:** Strategic adjustments for the week

### Content-to-Sales Pipeline
- Mr. Anfield articles mention Brandverse (authority building)
- Case studies from Brandverse → Mr. Anfield content
- Football industry leads → potential Brandverse clients
- Cross-pollination of audiences

### Shared Resources
- Both repos on GitHub (synced)
- Brandverse `/internal/sales-ops/` accessible on both PCs if needed
- Conversation history syncs via Antigravity
