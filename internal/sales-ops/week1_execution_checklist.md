## IF YOU'RE STUCK

**"No one is responding to emails"**
→ Call them instead. Dental owners prefer phone.

**"No one is picking up calls"**
→ Try different times: 8-9 AM or 12-1 PM (before/after rush).

**"I don't know what to say on calls"**
→ Use exact script in `outbound_sales_system.md`. Read it verbatim first 10 calls.

**"I'm scared to call"**
→ Remember: They lose $100K-$500K/year to missed calls. You're helping them.
