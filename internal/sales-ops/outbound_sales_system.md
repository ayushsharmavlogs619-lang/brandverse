# Outbound Sales Machine: Scripts & Sequences

## COLD EMAIL SEQUENCES

### DENTAL CLINIC SEQUENCE

#### Email 1: Initial Outreach (Day 1)

**Subject:** You're losing $8,500/month to missed calls

**Body:**
Dr. [Last Name],

I analyzed your practice's online presence and noticed something costing you serious money.

Most dental practices miss 20-38% of incoming calls. For a practice like yours, that's roughly **300 missed calls a month**.

If just 10% of those are new patients at $850 average value, you're losing **$25,500/month** — and that's a conservative estimate.

We fix this with a 24/7 AI receptionist that:
✓ Answers every call instantly (no more voicemail)
✓ Books appointments into your schedule automatically
✓ Sends SMS confirmations and reminders

[Practice Name in Your Area] added $42K in monthly bookings in 90 days with our system.

#### Email 2: Value Reinforcement (Day 4)

**Subject:** Quick follow-up: Your missed call problem

**Body:**
Dr. [Last Name],

Following up on my note from earlier this week.

Here's the math:

- You miss ~8 new patient calls/week (industry average)
- Each new patient = $850 immediate + $4,500 lifetime value
- **That's $312,000/year walking away**

Our AI receptionist costs $497/month and captures 95% of those calls.

Even if it only books 2 extra patients/month, you're up $1,700 — and it pays for itself 3x over.

Want to see how it works? I can show you in 10 minutes.

#### Email 3: Social Proof (Day 8)

**Subject:** How [Competitor Name] booked 47 more patients last month

**Body:**
Dr. [Last Name],

[Competitor Practice Name] in [City] had the same problem you do: missed calls.

They installed our AI receptionist 90 days ago.

**Results:**

- Call answer rate: 68% → 97%
- New patient bookings: +47/month
- Monthly revenue increase: $39,950

They didn't hire anyone. Didn't change anything else. Just plugged the leak.

#### Email 4: Breakup (Day 14)

**Subject:** Closing the loop

**Body:**
Dr. [Last Name],

I'll make this quick.

If you're happy with your current call handling, no problem — I'll close your file.

But if you're still losing new patients to missed calls (and the $300K+/year that comes with it), let's talk.

Reply "DEMO" and I'll send you a time to see it in action.

Otherwise, I won't reach out again.

Best,  
[Your Name]

### LAW FIRM SEQUENCE

#### Email 1: Initial Outreach (Day 1)

**Subject:** [First Name], you're losing clients to whoever answers first

**Body:**
[First Name],

75% of potential clients call multiple law firms when they have a legal issue.

The first firm to answer gets the case.

If your phones aren't answered 24/7, you're losing high-value cases to competitors — especially after-hours and on weekends when most people search for attorneys.

We built an AI intake agent that:
✓ Answers every call instantly (day, night, weekends)
✓ Qualifies the case (practice area, conflict check, urgency)
✓ Books consultations directly into your calendar

[Law Firm Name] increased their client conversion rate from 22% to 37% in 60 days using our system.

#### Email 2: Value Reinforcement (Day 4)

**Subject:** The 5-minute rule is costing you cases

**Body:**
[First Name],

Studies show that law firms who respond to inquiries within 5 minutes are **7x more likely** to convert the lead.

But most firms take hours — or miss the call entirely.

By the time you call back, the prospect has already hired someone else.

Our AI answers in 3 seconds. 24/7. No holidays. No sick days.

The average personal injury case is worth $15,000 in fees. If this saves you just ONE case/month, it pays for itself 15x over.

#### Email 3: Social Proof (Day 8)

**Subject:** How [Competitor Firm] added $180K in monthly case value

**Body:**
[First Name],

[Competitor Law Firm] was losing intake calls at night and on weekends.

They deployed our AI intake agent 90 days ago.

**Results:**

- After-hours leads captured: +126
- Conversion rate increase: 22% → 37%
- Monthly case value added: $180,000

Here's a sample intake call: [Demo Link]

The AI qualifies the case, checks conflicts, and books the consultation — all while sounding 100% human.

#### Email 4: Breakup (Day 14)

**Subject:** Last note

**Body:**
[First Name],

I haven't heard back, so I'm assuming this isn't a priority right now.

If you're still losing intake calls (and the $500K+/year in case value that comes with it), I'm happy to show you a demo.

Reply "YES" and I'll send my calendar.

Otherwise, I'll close your file.

## COLD CALLING SCRIPTS

### DENTAL CLINIC SCRIPT

**Goal:** Book a demo, not close on the call.

---

**OPENER:**
"Hi, this is [Your Name] with Brandverse. Is [Owner Name] available?"

[If gatekeeper asks what it's about]  
"I'm calling to show them how we're helping dental practices capture the 30% of calls they're currently missing. It'll take 2 minutes — is [Owner] around?"

---

**PITCH (Once connected):**
"Hi Dr. [Last Name], this is [Your Name] with Brandverse. Quick question: how many patient calls would you say your team misses each week?"

[Let them answer. Most will say "not many" or "I'm not sure."]

"That's what most practices think. Industry data shows the average practice misses 300 calls a month — and 65% of those are new patients. That's about $25,000 in lost revenue every month.

We built an AI receptionist that answers every call, 24/7, books appointments automatically, and sends confirmations. Most practices see 20-30% more bookings in the first 60 days.

I'd love to show you a quick demo — do you have 10 minutes tomorrow or Thursday?"

---

**OBJECTION HANDLING:**

**"We have a receptionist."**  
"That's great! Most of our clients keep their receptionist. The AI handles overflow, after-hours, and when your team is with in-office patients. Think of it like insurance — you're not losing calls when your staff is busy or out sick."

**"How much does it cost?"**  
"It's $497 a month. If it books just 2 extra patients, it pays for itself. Most practices see 20-30 additional bookings per month. Can I show you how it works?"

**"Sounds expensive."**  
"I get it. But here's the thing: one missed new patient call costs you $850 right away, and up to $4,500 over their lifetime. If our AI captures just 3 calls a month that would've been missed, you're up $2,550. That's a 5x return. Does that math make sense?"

**"We'll think about it."**  
"Totally fair. But here's the thing: every day you wait, you're losing calls. How about this — let me show you a 10-minute demo. If you hate it, you'll never hear from me again. If you love it, we can get you set up this week. Sound good?"

---

**CLOSE:**
"Great! I'm sending you a calendar invite for [Day/Time]. You'll get a text reminder. Looking forward to it, Dr. [Last Name]."

---

### LAW FIRM SCRIPT

**OPENER:**
"Hi, this is [Your Name] with Brandverse. I'm looking for [Attorney Name] or whoever handles intake. Are they available?"

[If gatekeeper asks what it's about]  
"I'm calling to show them how we're helping law firms capture intake calls they're currently losing after-hours and on weekends. Takes 90 seconds — is [Attorney] around?"

---

**PITCH:**
"Hi [First Name], this is [Your Name] with Brandverse. Quick question: what happens when someone calls your firm at 9 PM on a Saturday?"

[Let them answer. Most will say "voicemail" or "answering service."]

"Here's the problem: 75% of people with legal issues call multiple firms. The first one to answer gets the case.

We built an AI intake agent that answers 24/7, qualifies cases, checks for conflicts, and books consultations directly into your calendar.

[Competitor Firm] saw their conversion rate jump from 22% to 37% in the first 90 days. If your average case is worth $10K in fees, this pays for itself if it brings in just ONE extra case per month.

Do you have 15 minutes this week for a demo?"

---

**OBJECTION HANDLING:**

**"We use an answering service."**  
"That's smart — most firms do. But here's the difference: our AI qualifies the case in real-time, checks conflicts, and books the consultation while the prospect is still on the line. Traditional answering services just take a message. You still have to call back — and by then, they've hired someone else."

**"What if it sounds robotic?"**  
"Great question. Let me play you a sample call right now. [Play 30-second demo clip]. 95% of callers don't realize they're talking to AI. It's trained on thousands of real intake calls."

**"How much?"**  
"It's $997/month for most firms. If your average case is $10K in fees, you need ONE extra case every 10 months to break even. Most firms see 10-15 extra qualified cases per month. Want to see how it works?"

---

**CLOSE:**
"Perfect. I'll send you a calendar invite for [Day/Time]. I'll also send a sample intake call recording so you can hear it before we talk. Sound good?"

---

"Hey [First Name], thanks for connecting. I work with dental practices to solve the missed call problem (you know, the 300+ calls/month most practices lose). If you're tired of losing new patients to voicemail, happy to show you what we've built. Let me know!"

**LAW:**
"Hey [First Name], thanks for connecting. I help law firms capture intake calls they're missing after-hours. If you're losing cases because prospects call competitors who answer first, let's chat. Happy to share what we've built."

---

### Follow-Up (7 Days Later, If No Response)

**DENTAL:**

### 4. Implication Questions (2 minutes)

[Demo the AI, show sample call recording, walk through dashboard]

### 7. Calendar Lock

"I'm putting a follow-up on your calendar for Friday at 2 PM. You'll get a reminder. Looking forward to it!"

## OBJECTION HANDLING MASTER LIST

| Objection | Response |
|-----------|----------|
| "We already have a receptionist." | "Perfect. The AI handles overflow, after-hours, and busy times. Most clients keep their team and add the AI to capture the 30% of calls they're missing." |
| "Sounds expensive." | "It's $497/month. One missed new patient costs you $850+. If the AI books just 2 extra patients, it pays for itself. Most see 20-30 more bookings/month." |
| "What if it sounds robotic?" | "Let me play you a sample call. [Play demo]. 95% of callers don't realize it's AI. Want to hear another one?" |
| "We'll think about it." | "Totally fair. But here's the reality: every day you wait, you're losing calls. Let me show you a quick demo — if you hate it, I'll never bug you again. Deal?" |
| "I need to talk to my partner." | "Of course. What questions can I answer now so you're prepared for that conversation? ...Great. Let's book a 15-minute follow-up call with both of you. Does Thursday work?" |
| "We don't get that many calls." | "That might be true — or you might not realize how many you're missing because they don't leave voicemails. Want me to run a free call audit for you?" |
| "Can I see a demo first?" | "Absolutely. I'll email you a sample call recording and a 2-minute walkthrough video. If you like it, let's book 15 minutes to discuss. Sound good?" |
