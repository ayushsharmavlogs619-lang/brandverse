## RETENTION & EXPANSION

### Upsell Matrix

| Current Tier | Upsell Opportunity | Trigger | Additional MRR |
|--------------|-------------------|---------|----------------|
| Starter | Upgrade to Growth | Call volume > 200/mo | +$500 |
| Growth | Add outbound calling | 6 months tenure | +$300-$500 |
