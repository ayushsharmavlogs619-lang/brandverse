- Every "no" is one call closer to "yes"

### 3. SYSTEMIZATION

- Use templates for everything (emails, calls, onboarding)
- Track every metric in CRM
- Automate repetitive tasks ASAP

### 4. CUSTOMER OBSESSION

- Get testimonials within 90 days
- Over-deliver on onboarding
- Monthly check-ins = retention

## IF YOU GET STUCK

### "I don't have the AI technology built yet."

**Solution:** Partner with white-label AI voice providers (Vapi.ai, Bland.ai, Retell.ai) until you build your own. They offer reseller programs.

### "I don't know how to close."

**Solution:** Use the scripts in `outbound_sales_system.md`. Practice on 10 low-value leads first.

### "Leads aren't responding."

**Solution:**

- Personalize first line of email (mention something specific)
- Call instead of email (dental owners prefer phone)
- Test different subject lines

### "No one is buying."

**Solution:**

- Revisit qualification (are you targeting Tier 1 leads?)
- Improve demo (show actual call recording, not slides)
- Offer 30-day trial to remove risk

3. **Talk to customers daily.** Every conversation is data.
4. **Track everything.** You can't improve what you don't measure.
5. **Hire fast, fire fast.** Don't wait until you're drowning.
