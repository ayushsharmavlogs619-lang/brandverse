## SALES MESSAGING

### One-Sentence Pitch

**"We install an AI receptionist that answers every call 24/7, books appointments, and qualifies leads — so you never lose another customer to a missed call."**

---

### 30-Second Pitch

"Right now, you're losing $10,000+ every month to missed calls.

Here's the brutal truth: when your phone rings and no one picks up, that customer calls your competitor. And 75% of them never call you back.

We fix that with an AI voice agent that answers every single call — instantly, 24/7 — books appointments, qualifies leads, and integrates with your calendar and CRM.

Most clients see 20-40% more revenue in the first 90 days. Setup takes 48 hours. Want to see a demo?"

---

### Cold Outreach Pitch (Email)

**Subject:** You're losing $X/month to missed calls

**Body:**
[First Name],

Quick question: how many calls did your team miss last week?

If you're like most [dental practices / law firms / med spas], it's 20-40% of your inbound calls. And 75% of those people never call back.

That's $10K–$50K walking out the door every month.

We solve this with a 24/7 AI receptionist that:

- Answers every call instantly
- Books appointments into your calendar
- Qualifies leads before they hit your desk

[ClientName] added $30K in monthly revenue in 60 days. Zero extra staff.

Want a 15-min demo?

### Website Headline

**"Stop Losing Customers to Missed Calls"**

**Subheadline:**  
"Our AI receptionist answers 24/7, books appointments, and turns every call into revenue. Setup in 48 hours."

**CTA:** "See It In Action — Book a Demo"

---

### Call Booking CTA

**Primary CTA:** "Book a 15-Minute Demo"  
**Secondary CTA:** "Calculate Your Revenue Loss" (lead magnet: ROI calculator)

---

## OBJECTION HANDLING (PRE-EMPTIVE)

### "We already have a receptionist."

**Response:** "Perfect. Our AI handles overflow, after-hours, and peak times so your team can focus on in-person clients. Most clients keep their receptionist and add our AI to capture the 30% of calls they're currently missing."

### "What if the AI sounds robotic?"

**Response:** "Fair concern. Our voice agents are trained on millions of real conversations and sound 100% human. In fact, 95% of callers don't realize they're speaking to AI. Want to hear a sample call?"

### "This sounds expensive."

**Response:** "I get it. But think about it this way: if you're missing just 2 calls a day at $500 average sale, that's $1,000/day or $20,000/month in lost revenue. Our AI costs $497-$997/month and captures those calls 24/7. You'll pay for it in the first week."

### "What if it doesn't work for my industry?"

**Response:** "We've deployed AI agents in [dental, law, med spa, HVAC, real estate] with proven ROI. Every industry has calls. Every call has value. If you're skeptical, we have a 90-day profit guarantee: if you don't see 3x ROI, we refund you and work for free until you do."
