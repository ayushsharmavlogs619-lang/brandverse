## DENTAL CLINIC EMAILS

### Email 1: Initial Outreach

```
SUBJECT: You're losing $8,500/month to missed calls

Dr. [LAST_NAME],

I analyzed your practice's online presence and noticed something costing you serious money.

Most dental practices miss 20-38% of incoming calls. For a practice like yours, that's roughly 300 missed calls a month.

If just 10% of those are new patients at $850 average value, you're losing $25,500/month — and that's a conservative estimate.

We fix this with a 24/7 AI receptionist that:
✓ Answers every call instantly (no more voicemail)
✓ Books appointments into your schedule automatically  
✓ Sends SMS confirmations and reminders

[COMPETITOR_PRACTICE] in [CITY] added $42K in monthly bookings in 90 days with our system.

### Email 2: Follow-Up (Day 4)

```
SUBJECT: Quick follow-up: Your missed call problem

Dr. [LAST_NAME],

Following up on my note from earlier this week.

Here's the math:
- You miss ~8 new patient calls/week (industry average)
- Each new patient = $850 immediate + $4,500 lifetime value
- That's $312,000/year walking away

Our AI receptionist costs $497/month and captures 95% of those calls.

Even if it only books 2 extra patients/month, you're up $1,700 — and it pays for itself 3x over.

Want to see how it works? I can show you in 10 minutes.

### Email 3: Social Proof (Day 8)

```
SUBJECT: How [COMPETITOR_NAME] booked 47 more patients last month

Dr. [LAST_NAME],

[COMPETITOR_PRACTICE] in [CITY] had the same problem you do: missed calls.

They installed our AI receptionist 90 days ago.

Results:
- Call answer rate: 68% → 97%
- New patient bookings: +47/month
- Monthly revenue increase: $39,950

They didn't hire anyone. Didn't change anything else. Just plugged the leak.

Here's a 2-minute demo call recording: [DEMO_LINK]

### Email 4: Breakup (Day 14)

```
SUBJECT: Closing the loop

Dr. [LAST_NAME],

I'll make this quick.

If you're happy with your current call handling, no problem — I'll close your file.

But if you're still losing new patients to missed calls (and the $300K+/year that comes with it), let's talk.

Reply "DEMO" and I'll send you a time to see it in action.

Otherwise, I won't reach out again.

Best,

## LAW FIRM EMAILS

### Email 1: Initial Outreach

```
SUBJECT: [FIRST_NAME], you're losing clients to whoever answers first

[FIRST_NAME],

75% of potential clients call multiple law firms when they have a legal issue.

The first firm to answer gets the case.

If your phones aren't answered 24/7, you're losing high-value cases to competitors — especially after-hours and on weekends when most people search for attorneys.

We built an AI intake agent that:
✓ Answers every call instantly (day, night, weekends)
✓ Qualifies the case (practice area, conflict check, urgency)
✓ Books consultations directly into your calendar

[LAW_FIRM_NAME] increased their client conversion rate from 22% to 37% in 60 days using our system.

### Email 2: Follow-Up (Day 4)

```
SUBJECT: The 5-minute rule is costing you cases

[FIRST_NAME],

Studies show that law firms who respond to inquiries within 5 minutes are 7x more likely to convert the lead.

But most firms take hours — or miss the call entirely.

By the time you call back, the prospect has already hired someone else.

Our AI answers in 3 seconds. 24/7. No holidays. No sick days.

The average personal injury case is worth $15,000 in fees. If this saves you just ONE case/month, it pays for itself 15x over.

### Email 3: Social Proof (Day 8)

```
SUBJECT: How [COMPETITOR_FIRM] added $180K in monthly case value

[FIRST_NAME],

[COMPETITOR_FIRM] was losing intake calls at night and on weekends.

They deployed our AI intake agent 90 days ago.

Results:
- After-hours leads captured: +126
- Conversion rate increase: 22% → 37%
- Monthly case value added: $180,000

Here's a sample intake call: [DEMO_LINK]

The AI qualifies the case, checks conflicts, and books the consultation — all while sounding 100% human.

### Email 4: Breakup (Day 14)

```
SUBJECT: Last note

[FIRST_NAME],

I haven't heard back, so I'm assuming this isn't a priority right now.

If you're still losing intake calls (and the $500K+/year in case value that comes with it), I'm happy to show you a demo.

Reply "YES" and I'll send my calendar.

Otherwise, I'll close your file.

Best,
[YOUR_NAME]
